Implementations of the ISerialization and IBodyDeserializer interfaces, based on [Json.NET](http://json.codeplex.com/), for [Nancy](http://nancyfx.org)

## Usage

Start of by installing the `Nancy.Serialization.JsonNet` nuget

When Nancy detects that the `JsonNetSerializer` and `JsonNetBodyDeserializer` types are available in the AppDomain, of your application, it will assume you want to use them, rather than the default ones.

### Customization

If you want to customize the behavior of Json.NET, you can provide your own implementation of the `JsonSerializer` type. For example, the following implementation configures Json.NET to use camel-casing and to indent the output

```c#
public class CustomJsonSerializer : JsonSerializer
{
    public CustomJsonSerializer()
    {
        this.ContractResolver = new CamelCasePropertyNamesContractResolver();
        this.Formatting = Formatting.Indented;
    }
}
```

In order for Nancy to know that you want to use the new configuration, you need to register it in your bootstrapper. Here is an example of how you would do that using the `DefaultNancyBootstrapper`

```c#
public class Bootstrapper : DefaultNancyBootstrapper
{
    protected override void ConfigureApplicationContainer(TinyIoCContainer container)
    {
        base.ConfigureApplicationContainer(container);

        container.Register<JsonSerializer, CustomJsonSerializer>();
    }
}
```
